Conditionals:
Conditional tehmselver very help us to control the very flow of the program.That is if one thing happen the program do that thing.
and other thing happen the program do other thing.This is like a switch there can be only on or off no other thing just true or false.
Now for Python itself we're really using conditionals as boolean values.
That is true or false so true or false one or the other.
And we're going to be able to design our programs in such a way.
Now order for us to understand how to use a conditional we actually have to understand how to develop
some sort of boolean value from data.
