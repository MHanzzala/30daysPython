Variables:
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. 
Example:

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y) 

Variables can be use with strings For example abc="Simple string".Variable can be used and they help us extend our strings and all sorts of
things in our programming language in a way makes it easier for us.
