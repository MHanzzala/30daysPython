Strings:
String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
Strings can be a word long or a sentence or paragraph.
Strings can be output to screen using the print function. For example: print("hello").
We can also combine strings just like :
"This is a car" + "This is a bike".
You can see that we combine strings by Plus sign.So streams aren't that useful without the use of something called variable's.	
Strings can be multiplied just if we typing it out and multiply by any number for example:
"Strings" * 2 
"StringsStrings"
