String Substuition:
It is doubtful the subtraction operator is defined for strings (what it means to subtract a string is ambiguous, 
you could want it to do any number of things). You'll actually have to write code to make it do what you want, 
which is to replace that substring if it's present and perhaps some spaces as well.
