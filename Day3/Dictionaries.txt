dictionaries:
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values
Create and print a dictionary:

thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:

Example
Change the "year" to 2018:

thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018
